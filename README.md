# 2-Hour-Game-shipDraft
I didnt get nearly as much as I wanted to do done (obviously). I knew I wanted to make a spaceship game so I started off by making a csv file of ship hulls with hp values and costs. Then I set to work getting a basic file reader setup working with it and a class system to store them.

Later on I refactored it to use a more general 'part' class that it inherits from. Even with a system this small, I feel like this was w worthwhile endevour to keep things clear in my head.




Known issues (very glaring ones)
You have 1000 coins but the title screen says 100
On the first pick (hulls) it doesn't show the stats of the hulls
When using rarities of more than epic, they are never chosen (none included with the 2 hour files)
